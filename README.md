Windows only, certain command line commands are called and don't work on Linux.

To-Do list:

-fix core order so flame graphs aren't empty and refactor flame graph logic to its own function

-views: stable coverage, pull request coverage, coverage differences, coverage on changes, changes in coverage in areas that weren't altered, stable test times, pull request test times, test time differences, stable version flame graph, pull request flame graph
-general coverage, coverage in specific areas, test times, flame graphs
